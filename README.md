# Hebrew Male Female Classifier

College machine learning project: hebrew artikels gender classifier,
i used **sklearn SGDClassifier** for the  Classifying and **CountVectorizer** for text Vectorization and **StandardScaler** for scaling.
the hyperparams values was chosen with grid search wite cross validation.
I wrote the project in **Python language**  on **Jupyter Notebook**.
the goal of the project was to get max in **f1_macro** on [corpus_for_test](https://github.com/nikaloamashvili/Hebrew_Male_Female_Classifier/blob/main/corpus_for_test.csv "corpus_for_test.csv") i get on it 0.725 to 0.74 **f1_macro** .
I practice with this project the many machine learning algorithms and how to make them more precise.
